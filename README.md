Item ID Viewer is a simple yet effective addon that displays the item ID of any item in the game. The addon places a clickable frame on the player's screen, which will dynamically update to show the item ID of the item the player hovers over or interacts with. This allows players to quickly and easily identify item IDs without needing to dig through external resources.

/itemid - Displays available options.
/itemid color on/off - Toggles text color to match item quality.
/itemid show/hide - Shows or hides the IDDisplay frame.
/itemid reset - Resets all settings to default.
/itemid scale [1-10] - Sets the frame scale.
/itemid bg [1-10] - Sets the transparency of the frame.

Features:

    On-Screen Item ID Display: A movable frame that shows the item ID of any item the player interacts with.
    Chat Interaction: Clicking the frame automatically prints the displayed item ID into the chat window, allowing for quick sharing or referencing.
    Customization Options: The frame can be repositioned on the screen, making it easy to integrate with any user interface layout.

How It Affects User Experience:

    Streamlined Item Identification: No more searching for item IDs through third-party websites or add-ons. This addon provides immediate access to item IDs for any items you encounter in-game.
    Quick Sharing: Clicking the frame allows you to easily share the item ID with others, making it especially useful for raid leaders, guild members, or auction house enthusiasts who need to communicate item information quickly.
    Minimal Interface Disruption: The frame is small, unobtrusive, and can be moved anywhere on the screen, ensuring that it integrates seamlessly with any UI setup without blocking important gameplay elements.
